# FYS-STK3155

This is the folder for Project 1 by Jenny Holth Hartting and Alexander Schei.

In the code folder you will find "Run-File.ipynb", "Classes.py" and "Functions.py". 
"Run-File.ipynb" is a Jupyter Notebook that runs all the code found in "Classes.py" and "Functions.py". "Classes.py" contains the two main classes used for the linear regression and the plotting of data, while "Functions.py" contains all outside functions. In cases where our code is based on other work, it will be stated in the top of the ".py" file as well as above the relevant code. 

The data folder contains all result data in .txt files as well as elevation data ("Terrain_data_kartverket.tif") from "Oslo kommune tynnet laserskanning 2019" provided by Kartverket at www.hoydedata.no (see "terrain.png" in the figures folder for an illustration of the cropped version used in our modeling). Results from the terrain data are named with "._terrain.txt", the rest are from the Franke function. 

In the figures folder you will find all figures and plots from the "Run-File.ipynb". Figures and plots from terrain data are marked with "T_.", while the remaining are from the Franke function.  

We hope you enjoy your stay in "Project 1" :)
