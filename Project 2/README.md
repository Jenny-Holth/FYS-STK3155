# FYS-STK3155
This is the folder for Project 2 by Jenny Holth Hartting and Alexander Schei.

In the code folder you will find "RunFile.ipynb", "Classes.py", "Functions.py" and "Utilities.py". "RunFile.ipynb" is a Jupyter Notebook that runs all the code found in "Classes.py" and "Functions.py". "Classes.py" contains the two main classes and a fuction for initializing the classes for the neaural network and gradient calculations. "Functions.py" contains all outside functions, and "Utilities.py" contains all small functions like cost and activation funtions, they are stored seperate to avoid import loops as both other .py files need to import them. In cases where our code is based on other work, it will be stated in the top of the ".py" file as well as above the relevant code.

In the figures folder you will find all figures and plots from the "Run-File.ipynb", including some extra heat maps and confusion matrices.

We hope you enjoy your stay in "Project 2" :)
